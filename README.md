# Machine Learning A-Z Udemy Course
This is a VS solution containing my progress in the course, it contains 2 projects:
- Python project: containing the code for each algorithm written in python.
- R project: containing the code for each algorithm written in R.

The VS solution requires Python Tools for Visual Studio as well as R Tools for Visual Studio. Although I'm a PyCharm lover but I preferred using VS instead so it can contain all projects in one location. 

You will find all sample data accompanied in the solution as well.

I hope you find it useful.
